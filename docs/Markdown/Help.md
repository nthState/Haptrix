### How to use the Documentation

If you're stuck on using a particular tool, or need a deeper understanding of something in Haptrix, the documentation is a great first place to look for answers, I've tried to cover all areas of the App, if there is something I've missed, please send me a message.






### Why does this Documentation exist?

I've written the documentation to help you understand how Haptrix works, how it can help you create Haptic Experiences
