You may want to import audio into your Haptic, but don't want to spend time manually going through and adding events on prominent beats. We have a solution that does this automatically

### Audio File

Which audio file do you want to import






### Beat Detection

Check this if you want to add transient events on prominent beats






### AutoTrace

Check this if you want to add a parameter curve over the imported audio






### Sensitivity

Sometimes you may want finer control over the detection, you can increase or decrease the sensitivity to help with this
