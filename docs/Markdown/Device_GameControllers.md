### PlayStation 5 Dual Sense Controller

The Dual Sense Controller is a remarkable bit of kit. The PS5 Controller supports playing a Core Haptic file straight out of the box. Use the Export Menu in Haptrix to export a stub to help get you started






### Xbox Series X Controller

The Xbox Series X Controller also supports Core Haptics, I would say it's not as accurate as the PS5 Controller.
