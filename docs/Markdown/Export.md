### Export to *.AHAP File

The default option Haptrix supports is writing to AHAP files directly, these are the files which are supported natively by iOS 






### Export to Web Vibration API

Mobile Browsers like Chrome support the Web Vibration API, by using Javascript you can play a basic version of a Core Haptic file

Haptrix can also generate pure Swift code for your Haptic, whilst it is easier to use a AHAP file, sometimes you may wish to write code
